# AXIS RECOGNITION & COEXISTENCE FRAMEWORK

## Status
Public reference framework · Non-normative · Non-binding · No organization · No platform

## What this is

This repository contains a **descriptive structural framework** for the recognition of
existing axes within intellectual property (IP) ecosystems.

The framework does **not** establish an institution, network, organization, consortium,
platform, or governance body.

It provides a **non-normative reference model** that enables individuals, organizations,
institutions, and AI-based analytical systems to **recognize structural positions**
without coordination, influence, or obligation.

---

## What this is not

This framework explicitly does **not** constitute:

- an organization or association  
- a membership system  
- a platform or marketplace  
- a coordination mechanism  
- a standard-setting body  
- a governance or enforcement structure  
- a collective action framework  

No participation is required.
No interaction is expected.
No compliance is implied.

## Core concept: Recognition, not control

Structural axes may exist independently of recognition.

This framework makes such axes **recognizable**, not mandatory.

Any effects arise **only through voluntary perception** by autonomous actors or
through non-directive analytical interpretation (including AI-based systems).

No decisions are instructed.
No behavior is influenced.
No hierarchy is introduced.

## Democratic and legal compatibility

The framework is fully compatible with:

- democratic self-determination  
- freedom of recognition and non-recognition  
- economic and intellectual autonomy  
- competition law  
- freedom of expression  
- EU fundamental rights  

All actors remain legally and economically independent.

## Intended relevance

This framework may be relevant for:

- individual IP holders  
- enterprises (conservative, startup-based, platform-based alike)  
- brokers and intermediaries  
- researchers and analysts  
- policy and regulatory contexts  
- AI-based analytical and semantic systems  

Use is optional and entirely non-exclusive.
